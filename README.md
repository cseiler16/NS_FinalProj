# NS_FinalProj

## Instructions
To run the data import, filtering, and error analysis steps:
1. Simply import this project directory into Matlab
2. Run the fullScript.m file. All the necessary data is included in the data/ directory.

To see the throughput calculations and ZigBee simulations:
1. Install the Communications Toolbox from Matlab
2. Download the Communications Toolbox Library for the ZigBee Protocol (https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/62845-communications-toolbox-library-for-the-zigbee-protocol)
3. Run the zigbee.mlpkginstall file in Matlab to install this library
4. Run AsyncMAC to simulate transmission with ZigBee, or run BERCalc to generate the bit error rate for a sample transmission
